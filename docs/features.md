## 💸 Transaction Management

The heart of Wathīqah is the transaction ledger.

### Creating a Transaction
1.  Navigate to the **Transactions** tab.
2.  Click **"New Transaction"**.
3.  Select **Type**:
    *   **Given**: You gave money/item (Asset).
    *   **Received**: You received money/item (Liability).
4.  Select **Category**: Funds or Items.
5.  Enter **Details**: Amount/Quantity, Currency, Date, and Description.
6.  Select or Create a **Contact**.
7.  (Optional) Add a **Witness**.
8.  (Optional) Link to a **Project**.

### Managing Repayments (Returns)
When a debt is settled:
1.  Find the original transaction.
2.  Click **"Record Return"**.
3.  Enter the amount returned.
    *   *Partial Return*: The system tracks the remaining balance.
    *   *Full Return*: The transaction is marked as settled.

### Converting to Gift
If you decide to forgive a debt or if a loan becomes a gift:
1.  Open the transaction details.
2.  Select **"Convert to Gift"**.
3.  The system updates the record:
    *   **Given** → **Gift Given** (Expense/Generosity).
    *   **Received** → **Gift Received** (Income/Generosity).
    *   *Note*: Gifts do not count towards "Net Standing" debts.

## 👁️ Witness System

Add a layer of trust to your important transactions.

### Inviting a Witness
*   During transaction creation, enter the witness's email or phone number.
*   The system sends a secure invitation link.

### Witness Actions
*   **Pending**: The witness has been invited but hasn't acted.
*   **Acknowledged**: The witness verified the details.
*   **Declined**: The witness disputed the details.
*   **Modified**: The transaction was changed after witnessing; requires re-verification.

### Privacy
*   Witnesses only see the specific transaction they are invited to.
*   They do not see your other financial data or total balance.
