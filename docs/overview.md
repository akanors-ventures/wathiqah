# Project Overview

## 🎯 Purpose

**Wathīqah** (Arabic for "Document" or "Bond") is a digital ledger application designed to bring clarity and accountability to personal and shared finances. Unlike traditional expense trackers, Wathīqah focuses on **relationships** and **trust**. It allows users to document funds given, received, or collected, as well as physical items lent or borrowed.

The core philosophy is: **"Clarity Over Conflict."** By documenting financial interactions and involving trusted witnesses, Wathīqah helps preserve relationships that might otherwise be strained by forgotten debts or misunderstood agreements.

## 👥 Target Audience

Wathīqah is built for:

*   **Individuals**: Tracking personal loans, debts, and items lent to friends and family.
*   **Small Business Owners**: Managing informal credit, IOUs, and item tracking with partners or clients.
*   **Families**: Sharing financial responsibilities and tracking shared assets.
*   **Community Groups**: Managing pooled funds or shared resources with transparency.

## 💡 Key Concepts

### 1. Financial Philosophy
*   **Credit over Debt**: The system encourages a "Giver" mindset. Being a creditor (Blue/Given) is visually distinguished from being a debtor (Red/Received).
*   **Relationship-Centric**: Transactions are always linked to a "Contact." The system calculates your "Net Standing" with each contact—do they owe you, or do you owe them?

### 2. Transaction Categories
*   **FUNDS**: Monetary transactions. Supports multi-currency (NGN, USD, GBP, etc.) with real-time exchange rate conversion for reporting.
    *   *Types*: Given, Received, Returned (to me/contact).
*   **ITEMS**: Physical objects (e.g., tools, electronics, books). Tracks quantity and description.
    *   *Types*: Lent, Borrowed, Returned.

### 3. The Witness System
A unique feature of Wathīqah is the ability to add a **Witness** to any transaction.
*   **Accountability**: A third party verifies the transaction details.
*   **Security**: Witnesses receive a secure link to acknowledge or decline the record without needing full account access.
*   **Immutability**: Once witnessed, a transaction cannot be secretly altered. Any change notifies the witness and resets the verification status.

### 4. Shared Ledger & Perspective Flipping
When you transact with another Wathīqah user:
*   **Auto-Linking**: If you add a transaction with a user's email, it automatically appears in their ledger.
*   **Perspective Flipping**:
    *   If you record "I gave $50 to John", John sees "I received $50 from You".
    *   Your "Asset" becomes their "Liability".
    *   This ensures both parties see the same reality from their own perspective.

### 5. Projects
Group related transactions into **Projects** (e.g., "House Renovation", "Wedding", "Business Trip"). This allows for aggregated tracking of funds and items across multiple contacts and transaction types.
